# About This App

This is my eCommerce app built using modern Android technologies.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Dagger-Hilt** for dependency injection.  
- **Firebase** for authentication (Email & Password, Google) and Firestore database.  
- **Cloudinary** to store images instead of Firebase Storage to avoid the Spark plan limit.  
- **LoadingButton** for better UI experience.  
- **Circular Image** for user profile pictures.  
- **ViewBinding** to make UI handling easier.  
- **Fragments** to organize app screens.  
- **MVVM Architecture** to keep the code clean and structured.  
- **Navigation Component** to move between screens smoothly.  
- **BottomNavigation** for easy navigation between main screens.  
- **Internet Test** – If there is no internet, the app will shut down.  
- **Push Notifications** – Users can disable notifications, and when they reopen the app, it will ask for notification permission.  

## Learning & Customization  
I started learning this app from the **Land of Coding** YouTube channel. The course was not completed, so I finished the app on my own and made some modifications to improve it.  

## Current Work  
I am now working on an **eCommerce Admin App** that allows:  
- Editing uploaded products.  
- Adding new products.  
- Sending push notifications.  
- Receiving notifications for every order.  

## Upcoming Improvements  
- Adding a map selection feature for the address fragment.  

## Demo Video  
I have recorded a video showing all features and how the app works

I am always improving this app and learning new things!
